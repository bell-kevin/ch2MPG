# ch2MPG
A car holds 16 gallons of gas and can travel 312 miles before refueling. Write a program that calculates the number of miles per gallon that this car gets. Display a header, the miles traveled, the gallons used, and the result, which will have decimal places. Take a screenshot of the running program displaying the result.  Here is an example using different values: 

(NOTE: the numbers displayed here are not the correct solution for the code you are going to write -- this is for style only. Your code needs to calculate MPG for a car that holds 16 gallons of gas and travels 312 miles.)  Ch2 MPG  

Take a screenshot of the results using the numbers given above -- 16 gallons of gas, 312 miles). Run it again with different numbers and take a screenshot of that result.     

NOTE: Remember the requirements for a header and a pause at the end of the program, discussed in the reading "Console Applications". These are required in every console application project.  Submission: Submit a single zipped folder containing all of the specified screenshots AND the root folder for the project.

== We're Using GitHub Under Protest ==

This project is currently hosted on GitHub.  This is not ideal; GitHub is a
proprietary, trade-secret system that is not Free and Open Souce Software
(FOSS).  We are deeply concerned about using a proprietary system like GitHub
to develop our FOSS project. I have a [website](https://bellKevin.me) where the
project contributors are actively discussing how we can move away from GitHub
in the long term.  We urge you to read about the [Give up GitHub](https://GiveUpGitHub.org) campaign 
from [the Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org) to understand some of the reasons why GitHub is not 
a good place to host FOSS projects.

If you are a contributor who personally has already quit using GitHub, please
email me at **bellKevin@pm.me** for how to send us contributions without
using GitHub directly.

Any use of this project's code by GitHub Copilot, past or present, is done
without our permission.  We do not consent to GitHub's use of this project's
code in Copilot.
